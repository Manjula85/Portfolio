        <div class="grid-item unit2">I am an aspiring 'Full Stack Developer'. I am currently employed in the maintenance sector as a maintenance assistant. The inspiration towards creating a software was first as a solution for many issues I find myself at work. There are many tasks like keeping track of inventory and cataloguing purchases still being done through inefficient methods. I knew that it required more custom software, but I lacked the knowledge to do it. I did try to solve issues like keeping track of orders I purchased through learning SQL but I wasn't able to develop more on it. Even though I did try to learn other software online it was a very slow process. So that is when I thought of joining this course. But other than just solving the issues at work I would love to move into a better paying software development sector one day! </div>
